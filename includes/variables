<h1 id="variables">Variables</h1>

<p>Variables represent storage locations. Every variable has a type that determines what values can be stored in the variable. C# is a type-safe language, and the C# compiler guarantees that values stored in variables are always of the appropriate type. The value of a variable can be changed through assignment or through use of the <code class="prettyprint">++</code> and <code class="prettyprint">--</code> operators.</p>

<p>A variable must be <strong><em>definitely assigned</em></strong> (<a href="variables.md#definite-assignment">Definite assignment</a>) before its value can be obtained.</p>

<p>As described in the following sections, variables are either <strong><em>initially assigned</em></strong> or <strong><em>initially unassigned</em></strong>. An initially assigned variable has a well-defined initial value and is always considered definitely assigned. An initially unassigned variable has no initial value. For an initially unassigned variable to be considered definitely assigned at a certain location, an assignment to the variable must occur in every possible execution path leading to that location.</p>

<h2 id="variable-categories">Variable categories</h2>

<p>C# defines seven categories of variables: static variables, instance variables, array elements, value parameters, reference parameters, output parameters, and local variables. The sections that follow describe each of these categories.</p>

<p>In the example
&ldquo;`csharp
class A
{
public static int x;
int y;</p>

<p>void F(int[] v, int a, ref int b, out int c) {
int i = 1;
c = a + b++;
}
}
&rdquo;<code class="prettyprint">
</code>x<code class="prettyprint">is a static variable,</code>y<code class="prettyprint">is an instance variable,</code>v[0]<code class="prettyprint">is an array element,</code>a<code class="prettyprint">is a value parameter,</code>b<code class="prettyprint">is a reference parameter,</code>c<code class="prettyprint">is an output parameter, and</code>i` is a local variable.</p>

<h3 id="static-variables">Static variables</h3>

<p>A field declared with the <code class="prettyprint">static</code> modifier is called a <strong><em>static variable</em></strong>. A static variable comes into existence before execution of the static constructor (<a href="classes.md#static-constructors">Static constructors</a>) for its containing type, and ceases to exist when the associated application domain ceases to exist.</p>

<p>The initial value of a static variable is the default value (<a href="variables.md#default-values">Default values</a>) of the variable&rsquo;s type.</p>

<p>For purposes of definite assignment checking, a static variable is considered initially assigned.</p>

<h3 id="instance-variables">Instance variables</h3>

<p>A field declared without the <code class="prettyprint">static</code> modifier is called an <strong><em>instance variable</em></strong>.</p>

<h4 id="instance-variables-in-classes">Instance variables in classes</h4>

<p>An instance variable of a class comes into existence when a new instance of that class is created, and ceases to exist when there are no references to that instance and the instance&rsquo;s destructor (if any) has executed.</p>

<p>The initial value of an instance variable of a class is the default value (<a href="variables.md#default-values">Default values</a>) of the variable&rsquo;s type.</p>

<p>For the purpose of definite assignment checking, an instance variable of a class is considered initially assigned.</p>

<h4 id="instance-variables-in-structs">Instance variables in structs</h4>

<p>An instance variable of a struct has exactly the same lifetime as the struct variable to which it belongs. In other words, when a variable of a struct type comes into existence or ceases to exist, so too do the instance variables of the struct.</p>

<p>The initial assignment state of an instance variable of a struct is the same as that of the containing struct variable. In other words, when a struct variable is considered initially assigned, so too are its instance variables, and when a struct variable is considered initially unassigned, its instance variables are likewise unassigned.</p>

<h3 id="array-elements">Array elements</h3>

<p>The elements of an array come into existence when an array instance is created, and cease to exist when there are no references to that array instance.</p>

<p>The initial value of each of the elements of an array is the default value (<a href="variables.md#default-values">Default values</a>) of the type of the array elements.</p>

<p>For the purpose of definite assignment checking, an array element is considered initially assigned.</p>

<h3 id="value-parameters">Value parameters</h3>

<p>A parameter declared without a <code class="prettyprint">ref</code> or <code class="prettyprint">out</code> modifier is a <strong><em>value parameter</em></strong>.</p>

<p>A value parameter comes into existence upon invocation of the function member (method, instance constructor, accessor, or operator) or anonymous function to which the parameter belongs, and is initialized with the value of the argument given in the invocation. A value parameter normally ceases to exist upon return of the function member or anonymous function. However, if the value parameter is captured by an anonymous function (<a href="expressions.md#anonymous-function-expressions">Anonymous function expressions</a>), its life time extends at least until the delegate or expression tree created from that anonymous function is eligible for garbage collection.</p>

<p>For the purpose of definite assignment checking, a value parameter is considered initially assigned.</p>

<h3 id="reference-parameters">Reference parameters</h3>

<p>A parameter declared with a <code class="prettyprint">ref</code> modifier is a <strong><em>reference parameter</em></strong>.</p>

<p>A reference parameter does not create a new storage location. Instead, a reference parameter represents the same storage location as the variable given as the argument in the function member or anonymous function invocation. Thus, the value of a reference parameter is always the same as the underlying variable.</p>

<p>The following definite assignment rules apply to reference parameters. Note the different rules for output parameters described in <a href="variables.md#output-parameters">Output parameters</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li> A variable must be definitely assigned (<a href="variables.md#definite-assignment">Definite assignment</a>) before it can be passed as a reference parameter in a function member or delegate invocation.</li>
<li> Within a function member or anonymous function, a reference parameter is considered initially assigned.</li>
</ul>

<p>Within an instance method or instance accessor of a struct type, the <code class="prettyprint">this</code> keyword behaves exactly as a reference parameter of the struct type (<a href="expressions.md#this-access">This access</a>).</p>

<h3 id="output-parameters">Output parameters</h3>

<p>A parameter declared with an <code class="prettyprint">out</code> modifier is an <strong><em>output parameter</em></strong>.</p>

<p>An output parameter does not create a new storage location. Instead, an output parameter represents the same storage location as the variable given as the argument in the function member or delegate invocation. Thus, the value of an output parameter is always the same as the underlying variable.</p>

<p>The following definite assignment rules apply to output parameters. Note the different rules for reference parameters described in <a href="variables.md#reference-parameters">Reference parameters</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li> A variable need not be definitely assigned before it can be passed as an output parameter in a function member or delegate invocation.</li>
<li> Following the normal completion of a function member or delegate invocation, each variable that was passed as an output parameter is considered assigned in that execution path.</li>
<li> Within a function member or anonymous function, an output parameter is considered initially unassigned.</li>
<li> Every output parameter of a function member or anonymous function must be definitely assigned (<a href="variables.md#definite-assignment">Definite assignment</a>) before the function member or anonymous function returns normally.</li>
</ul>

<p>Within an instance constructor of a struct type, the <code class="prettyprint">this</code> keyword behaves exactly as an output parameter of the struct type (<a href="expressions.md#this-access">This access</a>).</p>

<h3 id="local-variables">Local variables</h3>

<p>A <strong><em>local variable</em></strong> is declared by a <em>local_variable_declaration</em>, which may occur in a <em>block</em>, a <em>for_statement</em>, a <em>switch_statement</em> or a <em>using_statement</em>; or by a <em>foreach_statement</em> or a <em>specific_catch_clause</em> for a <em>try_statement</em>.</p>

<p>The lifetime of a local variable is the portion of program execution during which storage is guaranteed to be reserved for it. This lifetime extends at least from entry into the <em>block</em>, <em>for_statement</em>, <em>switch_statement</em>, <em>using_statement</em>, <em>foreach_statement</em>, or <em>specific_catch_clause</em> with which it is associated, until execution of that <em>block</em>, <em>for_statement</em>, <em>switch_statement</em>, <em>using_statement</em>, <em>foreach_statement</em>, or <em>specific_catch_clause</em> ends in any way. (Entering an enclosed <em>block</em> or calling a method suspends, but does not end, execution of the current <em>block</em>, <em>for_statement</em>, <em>switch_statement</em>, <em>using_statement</em>, <em>foreach_statement</em>, or <em>specific_catch_clause</em>.) If the local variable is captured by an anonymous function (<a href="expressions.md#captured-outer-variables">Captured outer variables</a>), its lifetime extends at least until the delegate or expression tree created from the anonymous function, along with any other objects that come to reference the captured variable, are eligible for garbage collection.</p>

<p>If the parent <em>block</em>, <em>for_statement</em>, <em>switch_statement</em>, <em>using_statement</em>, <em>foreach_statement</em>, or <em>specific_catch_clause</em> is entered recursively, a new instance of the local variable is created each time, and its <em>local_variable_initializer</em>, if any, is evaluated each time.</p>

<p>A local variable introduced by a <em>local_variable_declaration</em> is not automatically initialized and thus has no default value. For the purpose of definite assignment checking, a local variable introduced by a <em>local_variable_declaration</em> is considered initially unassigned. A <em>local_variable_declaration</em> may include a <em>local_variable_initializer</em>, in which case the variable is considered definitely assigned only after the initializing expression (<a href="variables.md#declaration-statements">Declaration statements</a>).</p>

<p>Within the scope of a local variableintroduced by a <em>local_variable_declaration</em>, it is a compile-time error to refer to that local variable in a textual position that precedes its <em>local_variable_declarator</em>. If the local variable declaration is implicit (<a href="statements.md#local-variable-declarations">Local variable declarations</a>), it is also an error to refer to the variable within its <em>local_variable_declarator</em>.</p>

<p>A local variable introduced by a <em>foreach_statement</em> or a <em>specific_catch_clause</em> is considered definitely assigned in its entire scope.</p>

<p>The actual lifetime of a local variable is implementation-dependent. For example, a compiler might statically determine that a local variable in a block is only used for a small portion of that block. Using this analysis, the compiler could generate code that results in the variable&rsquo;s storage having a shorter lifetime than its containing block.</p>

<p>The storage referred to by a local reference variable is reclaimed independently of the lifetime of that local reference variable (<a href="basic-concepts.md#automatic-memory-management">Automatic memory management</a>).</p>

<h2 id="default-values">Default values</h2>

<p>The following categories of variables are automatically initialized to their default values:</p>

<ul>
<li> Static variables.</li>
<li> Instance variables of class instances.</li>
<li> Array elements.</li>
</ul>

<p>The default value of a variable depends on the type of the variable and is determined as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li> For a variable of a <em>value_type</em>, the default value is the same as the value computed by the <em>value_type</em>&lsquo;s default constructor (<a href="types.md#default-constructors">Default constructors</a>).</li>
<li> For a variable of a <em>reference_type</em>, the default value is <code class="prettyprint">null</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Initialization to default values is typically done by having the memory manager or garbage collector initialize memory to all-bits-zero before it is allocated for use. For this reason, it is convenient to use all-bits-zero to represent the null reference.</p>

<h2 id="definite-assignment">Definite assignment</h2>

<p>At a given location in the executable code of a function member, a variable is said to be <strong><em>definitely assigned</em></strong> if the compiler can prove, by a particular static flow analysis (<a href="variables.md#precise-rules-for-determining-definite-assignment">Precise rules for determining definite assignment</a>), that the variable has been automatically initialized or has been the target of at least one assignment. Informally stated, the rules of definite assignment are:</p>

<ul>
<li> An initially assigned variable (<a href="variables.md#initially-assigned-variables">Initially assigned variables</a>) is always considered definitely assigned.</li>
<li> An initially unassigned variable (<a href="variables.md#initially-unassigned-variables">Initially unassigned variables</a>) is considered definitely assigned at a given location if all possible execution paths leading to that location contain at least one of the following:

<ul>
<li>A simple assignment (<a href="expressions.md#simple-assignment">Simple assignment</a>) in which the variable is the left operand.</li>
<li>An invocation expression (<a href="expressions.md#invocation-expressions">Invocation expressions</a>) or object creation expression (<a href="expressions.md#object-creation-expressions">Object creation expressions</a>) that passes the variable as an output parameter.</li>
<li>For a local variable, a local variable declaration (<a href="statements.md#local-variable-declarations">Local variable declarations</a>) that includes a variable initializer.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>The formal specification underlying the above informal rules is described in <a href="variables.md#initially-assigned-variables">Initially assigned variables</a>, <a href="variables.md#initially-unassigned-variables">Initially unassigned variables</a>, and <a href="variables.md#precise-rules-for-determining-definite-assignment">Precise rules for determining definite assignment</a>.</p>

<p>The definite assignment states of instance variables of a <em>struct_type</em> variable are tracked individually as well as collectively. In additional to the rules above, the following rules apply to <em>struct_type</em> variables and their instance variables:</p>

<ul>
<li> An instance variable is considered definitely assigned if its containing <em>struct_type</em> variable is considered definitely assigned.</li>
<li> A <em>struct_type</em> variable is considered definitely assigned if each of its instance variables is considered definitely assigned.</li>
</ul>

<p>Definite assignment is a requirement in the following contexts:</p>

<ul>
<li> A variable must be definitely assigned at each location where its value is obtained. This ensures that undefined values never occur. The occurrence of a variable in an expression is considered to obtain the value of the variable, except when

<ul>
<li>the variable is the left operand of a simple assignment,</li>
<li>the variable is passed as an output parameter, or</li>
<li>the variable is a <em>struct_type</em> variable and occurs as the left operand of a member access.</li>
</ul></li>
<li> A variable must be definitely assigned at each location where it is passed as a reference parameter. This ensures that the function member being invoked can consider the reference parameter initially assigned.</li>
<li> All output parameters of a function member must be definitely assigned at each location where the function member returns (through a <code class="prettyprint">return</code> statement or through execution reaching the end of the function member body). This ensures that function members do not return undefined values in output parameters, thus enabling the compiler to consider a function member invocation that takes a variable as an output parameter equivalent to an assignment to the variable.</li>
<li> The <code class="prettyprint">this</code> variable of a <em>struct_type</em> instance constructor must be definitely assigned at each location where that instance constructor returns.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="initially-assigned-variables">Initially assigned variables</h3>

<p>The following categories of variables are classified as initially assigned:</p>

<ul>
<li> Static variables.</li>
<li> Instance variables of class instances.</li>
<li> Instance variables of initially assigned struct variables.</li>
<li> Array elements.</li>
<li> Value parameters.</li>
<li> Reference parameters.</li>
<li> Variables declared in a <code class="prettyprint">catch</code> clause or a <code class="prettyprint">foreach</code> statement.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="initially-unassigned-variables">Initially unassigned variables</h3>

<p>The following categories of variables are classified as initially unassigned:</p>

<ul>
<li> Instance variables of initially unassigned struct variables.</li>
<li> Output parameters, including the <code class="prettyprint">this</code> variable of struct instance constructors.</li>
<li> Local variables, except those declared in a <code class="prettyprint">catch</code> clause or a <code class="prettyprint">foreach</code> statement.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="precise-rules-for-determining-definite-assignment">Precise rules for determining definite assignment</h3>

<p>In order to determine that each used variable is definitely assigned, the compiler must use a process that is equivalent to the one described in this section.</p>

<p>The compiler processes the body of each function member that has one or more initially unassigned variables. For each initially unassigned variable <em>v</em>, the compiler determines a <strong><em>definite assignment state</em></strong> for <em>v</em> at each of the following points in the function member:</p>

<ul>
<li> At the beginning of each statement</li>
<li> At the end point (<a href="statements.md#end-points-and-reachability">End points and reachability</a>) of each statement</li>
<li> On each arc which transfers control to another statement or to the end point of a statement</li>
<li> At the beginning of each expression</li>
<li> At the end of each expression</li>
</ul>

<p>The definite assignment state of <em>v</em> can be either:</p>

<ul>
<li> Definitely assigned. This indicates that on all possible control flows to this point, <em>v</em> has been assigned a value.</li>
<li> Not definitely assigned. For the state of a variable at the end of an expression of type <code class="prettyprint">bool</code>, the state of a variable that isn&rsquo;t definitely assigned may (but doesn&rsquo;t necessarily) fall into one of the following sub-states:

<ul>
<li>Definitely assigned after true expression. This state indicates that <em>v</em> is definitely assigned if the boolean expression evaluated as true, but is not necessarily assigned if the boolean expression evaluated as false.</li>
<li>Definitely assigned after false expression. This state indicates that <em>v</em> is definitely assigned if the boolean expression evaluated as false, but is not necessarily assigned if the boolean expression evaluated as true.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>The following rules govern how the state of a variable <em>v</em> is determined at each location.</p>

<h4 id="general-rules-for-statements">General rules for statements</h4>

<ul>
<li> <em>v</em> is not definitely assigned at the beginning of a function member body.</li>
<li> <em>v</em> is definitely assigned at the beginning of any unreachable statement.</li>
<li> The definite assignment state of <em>v</em> at the beginning of any other statement is determined by checking the definite assignment state of <em>v</em> on all control flow transfers that target the beginning of that statement. If (and only if) <em>v</em> is definitely assigned on all such control flow transfers, then <em>v</em> is definitely assigned at the beginning of the statement. The set of possible control flow transfers is determined in the same way as for checking statement reachability (<a href="statements.md#end-points-and-reachability">End points and reachability</a>).</li>
<li> The definite assignment state of <em>v</em> at the end point of a block, <code class="prettyprint">checked</code>, <code class="prettyprint">unchecked</code>, <code class="prettyprint">if</code>, <code class="prettyprint">while</code>, <code class="prettyprint">do</code>, <code class="prettyprint">for</code>, <code class="prettyprint">foreach</code>, <code class="prettyprint">lock</code>, <code class="prettyprint">using</code>, or <code class="prettyprint">switch</code> statement is determined by checking the definite assignment state of <em>v</em> on all control flow transfers that target the end point of that statement. If <em>v</em> is definitely assigned on all such control flow transfers, then <em>v</em> is definitely assigned at the end point of the statement. Otherwise; <em>v</em> is not definitely assigned at the end point of the statement. The set of possible control flow transfers is determined in the same way as for checking statement reachability (<a href="statements.md#end-points-and-reachability">End points and reachability</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="block-statements-checked-and-unchecked-statements">Block statements, checked, and unchecked statements</h4>

<p>The definite assignment state of <em>v</em> on the control transfer to the first statement of the statement list in the block (or to the end point of the block, if the statement list is empty) is the same as the definite assignment statement of <em>v</em> before the block, <code class="prettyprint">checked</code>, or <code class="prettyprint">unchecked</code> statement.</p>

<h4 id="expression-statements">Expression statements</h4>

<p>For an expression statement <em>stmt</em> that consists of the expression <em>expr</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li> <em>v</em> has the same definite assignment state at the beginning of <em>expr</em> as at the beginning of <em>stmt</em>.</li>
<li> If <em>v</em> if definitely assigned at the end of <em>expr</em>, it is definitely assigned at the end point of <em>stmt</em>; otherwise; it is not definitely assigned at the end point of <em>stmt</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="declaration-statements">Declaration statements</h4>

<ul>
<li> If <em>stmt</em> is a declaration statement without initializers, then <em>v</em> has the same definite assignment state at the end point of <em>stmt</em> as at the beginning of <em>stmt</em>.</li>
<li> If <em>stmt</em> is a declaration statement with initializers, then the definite assignment state for <em>v</em> is determined as if <em>stmt</em> were a statement list, with one assignment statement for each declaration with an initializer (in the order of declaration).</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="if-statements">If statements</h4>

<p>For an <code class="prettyprint">if</code> statement <em>stmt</em> of the form:
<code class="prettyprint">csharp
if ( expr ) then_stmt else else_stmt
</code></p>

<ul>
<li> <em>v</em> has the same definite assignment state at the beginning of <em>expr</em> as at the beginning of <em>stmt</em>.</li>
<li> If <em>v</em> is definitely assigned at the end of <em>expr</em>, then it is definitely assigned on the control flow transfer to <em>then_stmt</em> and to either <em>else_stmt</em> or to the end-point of <em>stmt</em> if there is no else clause.</li>
<li> If <em>v</em> has the state &ldquo;definitely assigned after true expression&rdquo; at the end of <em>expr</em>, then it is definitely assigned on the control flow transfer to <em>then_stmt</em>, and not definitely assigned on the control flow transfer to either <em>else_stmt</em> or to the end-point of <em>stmt</em> if there is no else clause.</li>
<li> If <em>v</em> has the state &ldquo;definitely assigned after false expression&rdquo; at the end of <em>expr</em>, then it is definitely assigned on the control flow transfer to <em>else_stmt</em>, and not definitely assigned on the control flow transfer to <em>then_stmt</em>. It is definitely assigned at the end-point of <em>stmt</em> if and only if it is definitely assigned at the end-point of <em>then_stmt</em>.</li>
<li> Otherwise, <em>v</em> is considered not definitely assigned on the control flow transfer to either the <em>then_stmt</em> or <em>else_stmt</em>, or to the end-point of <em>stmt</em> if there is no else clause.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="switch-statements">Switch statements</h4>

<p>In a <code class="prettyprint">switch</code> statement <em>stmt</em> with a controlling expression <em>expr</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li> The definite assignment state of <em>v</em> at the beginning of <em>expr</em> is the same as the state of <em>v</em> at the beginning of <em>stmt</em>.</li>
<li> The definite assignment state of <em>v</em> on the control flow transfer to a reachable switch block statement list is the same as the definite assignment state of <em>v</em> at the end of <em>expr</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="while-statements">While statements</h4>

<p>For a <code class="prettyprint">while</code> statement <em>stmt</em> of the form:
<code class="prettyprint">csharp
while ( expr ) while_body
</code></p>

<ul>
<li> <em>v</em> has the same definite assignment state at the beginning of <em>expr</em> as at the beginning of <em>stmt</em>.</li>
<li> If <em>v</em> is definitely assigned at the end of <em>expr</em>, then it is definitely assigned on the control flow transfer to <em>while_body</em> and to the end point of <em>stmt</em>.</li>
<li> If <em>v</em> has the state &ldquo;definitely assigned after true expression&rdquo; at the end of <em>expr</em>, then it is definitely assigned on the control flow transfer to <em>while_body</em>, but not definitely assigned at the end-point of <em>stmt</em>.</li>
<li> If <em>v</em> has the state &ldquo;definitely assigned after false expression&rdquo; at the end of <em>expr</em>, then it is definitely assigned on the control flow transfer to the end point of <em>stmt</em>, but not definitely assigned on the control flow transfer to <em>while_body</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="do-statements">Do statements</h4>

<p>For a <code class="prettyprint">do</code> statement <em>stmt</em> of the form:
<code class="prettyprint">csharp
do do_body while ( expr ) ;
</code></p>

<p>Definite assignment checking for a <code class="prettyprint">for</code> statement of the form:
<code class="prettyprint">csharp
for ( for_initializer ; for_condition ; for_iterator ) embedded_statement
</code>
is done as if the statement were written:
<code class="prettyprint">csharp
{
for_initializer ;
while ( for_condition ) {
embedded_statement ;
for_iterator ;
}
}
</code></p>

<p>If the <em>for_condition</em> is omitted from the <code class="prettyprint">for</code> statement, then evaluation of definite assignment proceeds as if <em>for_condition</em> were replaced with <code class="prettyprint">true</code> in the above expansion.</p>

<h4 id="break-continue-and-goto-statements">Break, continue, and goto statements</h4>

<p>The definite assignment state of <em>v</em> on the control flow transfer caused by a <code class="prettyprint">break</code>, <code class="prettyprint">continue</code>, or <code class="prettyprint">goto</code> statement is the same as the definite assignment state of <em>v</em> at the beginning of the statement.</p>

<h4 id="throw-statements">Throw statements</h4>

<li> If <em>v</em> is an output parameter, then it must be definitely assigned either:

<ul>
<li>after <em>expr</em></li>
<li>or at the end of the <code class="prettyprint">finally</code> block of a <code class="prettyprint">try</code>-<code class="prettyprint">finally</code> or <code class="prettyprint">try</code>-<code class="prettyprint">catch</code>-<code class="prettyprint">finally</code> that encloses the <code class="prettyprint">return</code> statement.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>For a statement stmt of the form:
<code class="prettyprint">csharp
return ;
</code></p>

<ul>
<li> If <em>v</em> is an output parameter, then it must be definitely assigned either:

try try_block
catch(...) catch_block_1
...
catch(...) catch_block_n

<li> The definite assignment state of <em>v</em> at the beginning of <em>catch_block_i</em> (for any <em>i</em>) is the same as the definite assignment state of <em>v</em> at the beginning of <em>stmt</em>.</li>
<li> The definite assignment state of <em>v</em> at the end-point of <em>stmt</em> is definitely assigned if (and only if) <em>v</em> is definitely assigned at the end-point of <em>try_block</em> and every <em>catch_block_i</em> (for every <em>i</em> from 1 to <em>n</em>).</li>

<p>If a control flow transfer (for example, a <code class="prettyprint">goto</code> statement) is made that begins within <em>try_block</em>, and ends outside of <em>try_block</em>, then <em>v</em> is also considered definitely assigned on that control flow transfer if <em>v</em> is definitely assigned at the end-point of <em>finally_block</em>.
