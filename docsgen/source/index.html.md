# Introduction

C# is designed by the C# Language Design Team (LDT) in close coordination with the [Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) project, which implements the language.


If you discover bugs or deficiencies in the above, please leave an issue to raise them, or even better: a pull request to fix them.

For *new feature proposals*, however, please raise them for [discussion](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/labels/Discussion), and *only* submit a proposal as a pull request if invited to do so by a member of the Language Design Team (a "champion").
